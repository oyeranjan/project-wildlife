<h3><b><u>Wildlife Conservation</u></b></h3>
Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild plant and animal 
species and their habitats.<br>
 The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure that nature will be around for future generations to enjoy
 and also to recognize the importance of wildlife and wilderness for humans and other species alike.
 Many nations have government agencies and NGO's dedicated to wildlife conservation, which help to implement
 policies designed to protect wildlife. Numerous independent non-profit organizations also promote various wildlife
 conservation causes.

<h3><b><u>Major dangers to wildlife</u></b></h3>
Fewer natural wildlife habitat areas remain each year. Moreover, the habitat that remains has often been degraded to bear
 little resemblance to the wild areas which existed in the past.Habitat loss—due to destruction, fragmentation and 
degradation of habitat—is the primary threat to the survival of wildlife in the United States. When an ecosystem has
 been dramatically changed by human activities—such as agriculture, oil and gas exploration, commercial development or
 water diversion—it may no longer be able to provide the food, water, cover, and places to raise young. Every day there 
are fewer places left that wildlife can call home.<br>

<h3><b><u>Save Forest Save Wildlife</u></b></h3>
<p>Forests are indispensable to mankind. They provide us with wood, raw materials; prevent floods and soil erosion; 
increase underground water supply and humidity of air; provide an abode for the wildlife, check air pollution, etc. 
On a sunny day a large elm tree gives off vapor which is equivalent to 1500 gallons of water. Annual world production
 of forest products exceeds US $ 150 billion, thus playing a vital role in the economy of a nation. According to a UN
 report, rain forests have been destroyed to a large extent. Man has mercilessly chopped off trees without paying any 
attention to the destruction he is causing to his own life and future. Hillsides have been stripped off its vegetation
 cover in the Himalayas, which has become a major cause for the earthquakes, avalanches, and landslides. Deforestation
 not only diminishes the natural beauty of any place but also upsets the ecological balance of that place. It is believed
 that the Thar Desert is a man-made desert.</p><br>
<p>Wildlife is at the brink of destruction! Due to destruction of forests, pollution, climatic changes and extensive
 hunting of animals, many species of wildlife have become extinct. With extension, when a species disappears, it is gone
 forever! Wildlife destruction has upset the whole mechanism of natural regulation and balance, which could endanger our
 very existence. Animals are being used widely in drug research nowadays. Scientists believe that animal experimentation
 is necessary for the progress of medical sciences. They may be right but what we need is a balance between biomedical
 research and animal welfare.</p><br>

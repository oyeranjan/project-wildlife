<h3><b><u>WCS Global Mission</u></b></h3>
The Wildlife Conservation Society (www.wcs.org) saves wildlife and wild 
places worldwide. It does so through science, conservation, education and
 the management of the world’s largest system of urban wildlife parks, led
 by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes
 towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in 
harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the
 integrity of life on earth. Wildlife Conservation Society has furthered
 its global mission in India since 1988 through activities of its staff
 and partners.<br>

<h3><b><u>WCS – India Program</u></b></h3>
Wildlife Conservation Society – India Program describes the work of several
 partner institutions engaged in saving wildlife and wild lands in full 
compliance with all Indian laws.<br>
Its roots go back to 1963, to the first-ever scientific study of wild tigers
 by Dr. George Schaller. Following his footsteps, a quarter century later,
 WCS scientist Dr. Ullas Karanth initiated the first detailed ecological 
study of tigers in India employing radio telemetry at Nagarahole, Karnataka.
 This single research project in Nagarahole has today grown into a 
successful country wide effort to understand and save India’s national
 animal.<br>
WCS – India Program mission has combined cutting-edge research on tigers
 and other wildlife, with national capacity building and effective site-based
 conservation through constructive collaborations with governmental and 
non-governmental partners. Uncompromisingly committed to wildlife
 conservation, WCS – India Program inspires and nurtures positive attitude
 towards nature in people through its scientific and conservation endeavors.<br>

<h3><b><u>What We Do</u></b></h3>
<p>India’s unique bio-geography and long evolutionary history rank it among 17 mega-diverse nations of the world. Of the 226 carnivores on earth, 52 species – ranging from lions, tigers, snow leopards, leopards, hyenas and three species of bears occur in India. India has a rich vertebrate fauna that is a spectacular combination of Indo-Malayan, Afro-tropical and Palearctic elements. There are over 600 nature reserves in the country, which cover about five per cent of the land. However, human population growth and increasing consumption and aspirations pose serious conservation challenges. Effective action to save wildlife and wild places is now an urgent need. WCS – India Program addresses these challenges uniquely. It dedicates and helps in application of its significant scientific skills and intellectual authority to the task of recovering wildlife and wild lands. More than 50 staff scientists, conservationists and their associates have their 
boots on the ground, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p><br>
<p>We support a multi-pronged conservation strategy that includes cutting-edge wildlife research, context specific conservation models and passionate local interventions. We combine long term collaborations with local communities to resolve conflicts and reduce their impacts on wildlife, with careful policy interventions. We support and build national conservation capacity at all spatial and social scales. We work with partners who include India’s Central and State governments, local and international NGOs, media, social leaders and passionate community conservation leaders who are deeply rooted in local
 societies that live in proximity to wildlife.</p><br>

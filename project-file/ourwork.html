<h3><b><u>CRITICAL REGIONS</u></b></h3>
In early 2000, WWF-India realized that approaches to conservationexisting then were no longer effective, and the time had come to seek new and improved strategies towards safeguarding the populations of India’s wildlife and their habitats. In 2002-03, the landscape approach to conservation was adopted by WWF-India to revolutionize the overall conservation strategy to one that harmonized the needs of wildlife with the needs of local communities. The new approach represented a paradigm shift in focus from one that was selective in its focus only on Protected Areas to one that encompassed vast regions represented by a string of Protected Areas connected through Reserve Forests and human dominated areas. The landscape approach has been hailed as a comprehensive driving force towards a large, safe and sustainable habitat for wildlife and includes long-term conservation focus with strategies for land use change, livelihoods and development policies across the landscape.<br>
Currently, WWF-India is addressing species conservation through field level activities in different landscapes as well as through direct interventions aimed at conserving a particular species. These programmes focus on threats to wildlife and the issues surrounding these threats. Prominent among these are poaching, human-wildlife conflict, trade in wildlife parts, habitat destruction and legal support. The project activities are carried out at field as well as policy levels. They are mainly related to scientific information gathering, working with the local communities, NGOs and government agencies including the state forest departments.<br>

<h3><b><u>PRIORITY SPECIES</u></b></h3>
Wildlife species conservationat WWF-India began with the initiation of the Tiger Conservation Programme (TCP) in the early 1970s. In the year 2000, the programme diversified into several conservation projects targeting tigers, Asian elephant and rhino, and in 2005, added Nilgiri tahr, red panda and snow leopard to the list. The programme used a landscape conservation approach, which replaced the former strategy of focusing only on the Protected Areas. This approach involves local communities by making them stakeholders in relevant conservation issues of the area and implementing field level activities and direct interventions across different landscapes.<br>
WWF-India works on the following priority species that have global and/or national importance:<br>
<b>>>Bengal tiger<br>
>>Asian elephant<br>
>>Indian or greater one-horned rhino<br>
>>Ganges river dolphin<br>
>>Snow leopard<br></b>
Apart from the priority species, WWF-India also has a Threatened Species Conservation Programme that includes the following species:<br>
<b>>>Black-necked crane<br>
>>Nilgiri tahr<br>
>>Red panda<br>
>>Great Indian bustard<br>
>>Sarus crane<br>
>>Himalayan quail<br>
>>House sparrow<br>
>>Common leopard<br>
>>Smooth-coated otter<br>
>>Gharial<br></b>

<h3><b><u>Hundreds of new species discovered</u></b></h3>
A biological treasure trove of over 200 new species was discovered in the Eastern Himalayas between 2009 and 2014, according to WWF Living Himalayas Initiative’s latest regional species discovery report.The report, released today in Bhutan on World Habitat Day, is entitled  “Hidden Himalayas: Asia’s Wonderland”, and maps out scores of new species found by scientists from various organizations across  a region spanning Bhutan, north-east India, Nepal, the far north of Myanmar and the southern parts of Tibet.</br>
The 211 discoveries include 133 plants, 39 invertebrates, 26 fish, 10 amphibians, one reptile, one bird and one mammal. Some of the most striking discoveries include a vibrant blue dwarf ‘walking’ snakehead fish (Channaandrao) which can breathe atmospheric air and survive on land for up to four days although, moving in a manner much clumsier than a smoothly slithering snake. The report details an unfortunate monkey (Rhinopithecusstrykeri) whose upturned nose leads to a sneeze every time the rain falls, and a living gem - the bejeweled lance-headed pit viper (Protobothropshimalayansus) -which could pass as a carefully crafted piece of jewellery. </br>
